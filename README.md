# GBA Filter.
User Filtering Project with React and Axios
This project is a simple web application that uses React for the frontend and Axios for making backend calls. It allows you to filter users in a table and display them based on specified filter criteria.

## Requirements
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Configuration
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local environment:

1. ### Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone <repository URL>
    ```

1. ### Install dependencies:

    Navigate to the project folder and execute the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd nombre-del-proyecto

    npm install
    ```
1. ### Configure the Backend URL in the .env File:

    In the project's root directory, you'll need to create a .env file. Open it and set the backend URL environment variable as follows:

    ``` 
    REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://your-backend-url.com
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > For guidance on setting up your .env file correctly, refer to the .env.example file.

## Run the application:

Once you have configured the backend URL, you can run the application with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React application in development mode and open it in your default web browser.
